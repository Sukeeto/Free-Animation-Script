# ATTETION!!

- The Script needs to be in a "LocalScript".
- LocalScript needs to be in "StarterCharacterScripts" which is in "StarterPlayer".
- If you want to use this code but just modify the animation, just copy the ID of the animation you want to, and replace it with a set of numbers that will be repeated 4 times in each session (Separated by --------- -------)

Video showing the animation: https://youtu.be/eZrdtQshzgI

Script:
[Script_Animation_Roblox.txt](https://github.com/Sukeeto/Free-Animation-Script/files/6415842/Script_Animation_Roblox.txt)

I put the scritp in a .txt file to keep it more organized.
