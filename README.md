# ATTETION!!

- The Script needs to be in a "LocalScript".
- LocalScript needs to be in "StarterCharacterScripts" which is in "StarterPlayer".
- If you want to use this code but just modify the animation, just copy the ID of the animation you want to, and replace it with a set of numbers that will be repeated 4 times in each session (Separated by --------- -------)
